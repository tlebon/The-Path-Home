Thanks for checking out my game! this is my first project for Ironhack! I very much enjoyed the process of putting together the game: finding new features and ideas as I programmed, using happy accidents to discover new ways of playing or presenting information, and understanding why things dont work! If I continue to work on it I might change the combat, add new maps, new hidden items, more discoverables and more stats. 

Made with bootstrap and jQuery! 

Many thanks as well to Duri the Dwarf, a previous ironhack game from which I drew lots of inspiration.
